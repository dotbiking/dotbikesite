<p>Thousands of people are working from home, not driving or Ubering. The streets are so empty, MBTA buses can actually make their schedules. (The buses are <a href="https://mbtabackontrack.com/blog/112-covid-19-and-mbta-ridership-part-2">almost empty too</a>, of course.) Biking and walking are safer and more pleasant. In Massachusetts, <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/04/06/data-dump-total-driving-is-down-in-all-major-cities/">driving is down</a> by 75%, which will undoubtedly lead to a greenhouse gas emissions drop as well.</p>



<p>How can we preserve these trends after social isolation is over and the state’s economy starts to revive? What are your ideas? Here are mine to provoke yours.</p>



<h2><strong>State and city policies?</strong></h2>



<ol><li>Massive incentives for telework.</li><li>State-corporate collaboration to limit work traffic. Could companies require employees to come in only on certain days of the week, and stagger those days?</li><li>Congestion pricing downtown or tolling on all routes into Boston. (Three-quarters of transportation emissions in Boston are generated by trips that start or end outside the city.)<sup><a href="#sdendnote1sym"><sup>i</sup></a></sup></li><li>Bus rapid transit lines on all high-volume routes.</li><li>Much, much more bike infrastructure, installed quickly.</li><li>“Ride-sharing” fees that users pay.</li><li>Speedy adoption of the <a href="https://www.transportationandclimate.org/">Transportation Climate Initiative</a> to help pay for these. (The state budget is going to need help for the next several years.)</li></ol>



<h2><strong>What about the negative trends?</strong></h2>



<p>Along with the positive current trends, some negative ones are being established and they won’t be easy to overcome.</p>



<ul><li><em><a href="https://mbtabackontrack.com/blog/116-covid-19-and-mbta-ridership-part3">Catastrophic drop in public transit ridership</a>.</em> Could the MBTA offer <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2020/01/06/the-wild-idea-making-mbta-buses-free-gaining-traction/A5mw1bOfykqS9JdY6vXNIJ/story.html?event=event12">free fares</a> to get people back onto the T?</li><li><em>Driving alone in your car. </em>People with cars are going solo now to avoid virus transmission, and they’ll probably continue to for a long time. Should we discourage driving generally? Or discourage solo trips somehow?</li><li><em>Light traffic. </em>Right now there’s so little traffic, car trips are fast. (Hasn’t stopped drivers from honking.) That may continue if the transition out of virus-land is gradual.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Culture changes?</strong></h2>



<p>Policy creates transportation options for us, but culture (and necessity) drives the choices we make. I hope you have more ideas about changing our culture than I have. My only idea is: behaviorally, our culture is radically changed right now. There have to be ways to work off that starting point.</p>



<p>One obvious first step: pull our advocacy groups together and start brainstorming.</p>



<p><strong>PS</strong>:  <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/resources/emergency-stabilization-economic-recovery-recommendations/">Here</a> are some good national-level recommendations from the Smart Growth Alliance, and some <a href="https://rmi.org/coronavirus-and-the-fragility-of-auto-centric-cities/">more good ideas</a> from the Rocky Mountain Institute. </p>
